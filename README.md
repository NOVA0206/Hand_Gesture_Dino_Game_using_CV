# ðŸ¦– Hand Gesture Controlled Dino Game using Computer Vision

This project lets you **control the Chrome Dino game** using your **hand gestures** via OpenCV and MediaPipe.  
It tracks your hand landmarks and detects how many fingers are open or closed to control the dinosaurâ€™s actions.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

- **`main.py`** â€” Main script that captures webcam feed, detects hand gestures, and triggers Dino game actions.
- **`directkeys.py`** â€” Script to simulate keyboard key presses for controlling the Dino.
- **`handland_marks.png`** â€” Image reference for hand landmark positions (from MediaPipe).
- **`README.md`** â€” Project documentation.
- **`LICENSE`** â€” MIT license for open-source usage.

## ðŸŽ® How It Works

1. **Hand Tracking** â€” Uses MediaPipe to detect 21 landmarks on your hand in real-time.
2. **Finger Count Detection** â€” Determines how many fingers are open based on landmark positions.
3. **Game Control Logic**:
   - **1 to 4 fingers open** â†’ Dino keeps running (no jump).
   - **All 5 fingers closed (fist)** â†’ Dino jumps.

The detection is continuous, so you can play the game without touching the keyboard.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Make sure you have **Python 3.7+** installed.

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Hand_Gesture_Dino_Game_using_CV.git
   cd Hand_Gesture_Dino_Game_using_CV

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe
   ```

---

## ðŸ–¥ Usage

1. Open the **Chrome Dino Game**:

   * Disconnect from the internet and press space in Chrome **OR**
   * Visit: [chrome://dino](chrome://dino)

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. Make sure your webcam is active and your hand is visible in the frame.

4. Control the Dino:

   * Show **1â€“4 open fingers** â†’ Dino runs as usual.
   * Make a **closed fist** (0 fingers open) â†’ Dino jumps.

## ðŸ“„ Hand Landmark Reference

The file `handland_marks.png` shows how MediaPipe indexes the 21 landmarks on the hand.
This project uses those points to calculate finger positions and determine if they are open or closed.
